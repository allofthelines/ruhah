        <div id="asks" class="content-section" style="display: none;">
            <p>
            Ask is a form with which you request an outfit idea from other users.<br>
            <h3>Who creates the outfits for the asks?</h3>
            Other Ruhah users, so stylists at heart or profession.
            An ask can either be open for everyone to style, only visible to people you follow,
            or private to an account of your choice.
            <h3>How are the outfits created?</h3>
            For each ask, multiple different users create and submit their own outfit idea for your ask.
            Then our algorithm selects one of them, which is the one you see.
            <h3>What should i write in the ask's stylist notes?</h3>
            Anything that could help a human get it. You can describe a mood you're into, a trend you wanna explore, a specific occasion
            or an idea you already have but need help with.
            <h3>Can i buy an outfit's items?</h3>
            Yes, all the items (clothes and accessories) in an outfit are available for purchase.
            <h3>Do i have to buy something in it?</h3>
            No. You can just use the outfit as an inspiration.
            <h3>Is creating and submitting an ask free?</h3>
            Yes.
            <h3>Can i create an outfit for another user's ask?</h3>
            Yes, in the studio. Visit the studio help section for more info on how it works.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="trending" class="content-section" style="display: none;">
            <p>
            In the trending page you discover new outfits made by other users. Each one is signed by the creator,
            so you can explore and follow other users' profiles.<br><br>
            Outfits are ranked depending on their popularity in the past few days.<br><br>
            You can customise your trending page so that it only shows outfits from
            accounts you follow or outfits of a specific style, like boho or streetwear.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="box" class="content-section" style="display: none;">
            <p><h3>What is a Ruhah Box?</h3>
            A box delivered to you that includes 6-8 items.
            These items make for 2 different outfits, 3-4 items each,
            curated by human stylists based on your personal requests.
            <h3>Do i have to buy everything in it?</h3>
            No. You buy and keep only the items you want to.
            The rest you put them back to the box and return them to us for free.
            <h3>How are the outfits curated?</h3>
            Currently our outfit selection system includes a combination of stylist curation,
            public voting and decision making by our in-house fashion experts and trend analysts.
            In the future we will offer the option to choose a specific stylist of your choice to make your outfit.
            <h3>What do i pay for?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A $15 styling fee to order the Box. This includes all Box shipping costs, both delivery and return.</li>
                <li>The price of each item that you want to keep.</li>
            </ul>
            The styling fee is returned to you as discount on the items you purchased.<br>
            If you decide to keep all the items that belong to the same outfit you get -20% discount on them.<br>
            <h3>Is it a subscription service?</h3>
            No. You only pay each time you order a Box.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="studio" class="content-section" style="display: none;">
            <p>
                In the studio page you can view other users' asks and create outfits for them.<br>
                <h3>How do i create an outfit?</h3>
                In the studio, you first select one of the available asks, then choose the clothes and accessories you like, and finally submit it.
                <h3>How do I search for items to include in my outfit?</h3>
                You can search for items using keywords that you think describe
                the item you have in mind and its attributes ("blue" "distressed" "stripes" "loafer" etc).
                We provide a keyword guide to assist you, but feel free to try different keywords if you
                don't find what you're looking for with the first try.
                <h3>Do I need to worry about the sizes of the items I select?</h3>
                No. Our item search algorithm automatically filters items to fit the size of the user that created the ask.
                You, the creator, can focus purely on aesthetics and style.
                <h3>What kind of items are available in the catalogue?</h3>
                The catalogue includes a wide range of clothing items such as shirts, trousers, dresses,
                and accessories like bags and glasses. These items can be either new or pre-owned
                and come from our own collection or from suppliers we collaborate with.
                If an item appears in your search, it is available and ready to ship.
                <h3>Why are some asks yellow?</h3>
                The user that submitted a yellow ask follows you at Ruhah.
                <h3>Why are some asks red?</h3>
                This is a private ask. The user that submitted the red request specifically created
                this ask for you and only you to see. In your profile settings you can choose whether you can
                have private asks open, and whether they are free or you want to charge a fee.
        </div>
        <div id="stylists" class="content-section" style="display: none;">
            <p>
                Stylists, at heart or at profession, are registered users who create outfits for other users' asks.
                As a stylist you earn money every time a user purchases clothes or accessories you recommended.
                <br>
                <h3>How do stylists earn money?</h3>
                Every time a user buys an item from an outfit a stylist created. The amount earned is
                a percentage of the final price. That percentage changes depending on
                the occasion but the range is from 15% to 30%.
                <h3>What happens after a stylist creates and submits an outfit?</h3>
                For each user request, up to 10 stylists recommend an outfit each.
                In the next few hours our algorithm selects one of them, depending on factors like
                the ask creator's profile and the outfit's popularity. This outfit is displayed in
                the creator's profile and they are free to either buy or not items from that outfit.
                <h3>What happens if they don't buy anything?</h3>
                Nothing.
                <h3>Is there any other way to earn money?</h3>
                Yes. The outfits you create in the studio appear in your profile grid.
                Every time a user likes an outfit in your profile and purchases an item from it,
                you get 10% of that sale.
                <h3>Is it really that simple?</h3>
                Yes. You sign up, start styling, and earn money each time your items are bought.
